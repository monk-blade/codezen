# System
- preload 
	- `sudo apt install preload`
	- Preload is a daemon that runs in the background and tracks which applications we use the most and which files they need. Based on this analysis, it auto-loads those files, speeding up the loading times of our favorite apps.
- zram
	- `sudo apt install zram-config`
	- zRam creates a compressed swap space in your RAM. When your RAM starts filling up, zRAM will start compressing some of its contents without having to turn to swap space on your storage devices.
